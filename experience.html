    <b> <h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT:</h1></b>
            <h4>A virtual course on Web development at "MANAC Infotech (P) Ltd".The training commenced and I started with HTML and CSS simultaneously, watching all the videos comprehensively. The modules were short, simple, and descriptive enough to raise my interest in this domain. I progressed to the next module which was Bootstrap. Working on Bootstrap presented the real fun and it made me love coding. Once I had learned the concepts, I didn’t even need to write the complete code; I’d just add the class name and observe the magic! The next module was about SQL which I found comparatively difficult, but I guess it was made so to instigate critical thinking in students. The most challenging part was PHP since I didn’t even know what it meant. I was worried about linking backend and frontend development but all my doubts and worries were removed during this training. I appreciated how challenging the assignment for this section was.</h4><br>
            <h1>Summer Internship at RINL:</h1>
            <h4>RINL Steel Plant is a fast paced ,Set continuous casting steel rolling mills make itself a competitive ground on a day to day basis as every second is money in terms of materials manufactured at the place.
               Everyday is a new challenge and at the same time its a place of great minds collaborating with each other. Since it is a Government company, I got a very good opportunity to work over there, where I got lot of real life exposure in Training & Development. The staff were very helpful and solved a lot of doubts without any hesitation.</p>
               <h1>AutoCAD :</h4>
               <h4>Completed a course on AutoCad at “VERZEO” under “AUTODESK”. This course involved the understanding of drafting tools and how to draw different components using Autocad. There's a lot to learn on the job, and the mentors really help in easing the interns into the codebase. That being said, the employees are really approachable whenever there's any help required. The timings are flexible and there is no real pressure of deadlines (atleast for the interns).The projects are great, and absolutely relevant to the company. Needless to say, interns aren't assigned "toy projects", and instead get challenging and stimulating projects.</h4><br>
             <h1>IC ENGINES :</h1>
             <h4>A virtual course on AutoCAD & IC ENGINES at “InMovidu Technologies Pvt. Limited”. Well, this was an excellent experience and one must go through this. My internship experience is very concerning because I have acquired and learned new skills. The internship has enriched my knowledge in IC ENGINES.</h4><br>
             <h1>SOLID EDGE:</h1>
             <h4>I learnt solid edge through APSSDC online training, where they focused on the fundamental skills and concepts central to the use of Solid Edge. They uncovered all of the potential uses of production level solid modeling and introduces techniques for using Synchronous Technology. This course involved the understanding of different SOLID EDGE tools and how to draw different parts and how to assemble it.</h4><br>
             <h1>CATIA V5 workshop:</h1>
             <h4>Completed a course on CATIA V5 Foundation for Aerospace Part Designer at “APSSDC”. This course involved the understanding of basics of CATIA V5 for Aerospace Part Designer. CATIA is a multi-platform software-suite for Computer-Aided-Design (CAD), Computer-Aided-Manufacturing (CAM), Computer-Aided-Engineering, PLM and 3d.It is used in designing like shape design, electrical, fluid and electronic systems design, mechanical engineering and system engineering.</h4><br>
             <h1>NX-CAD workshop:</h1>
             <h4> Completed a course on Essentials for NX Designers at “APSSDC” in association with “SIEMENS”. This course involved the understanding of different NX tools and how to draw different components and how to assemble it. In every module like part, surface, drafting, assembly have more variety in command than other CAD software.</h4><br>
             <h1>Robotics Workshop</h1>
             <h4> Completed a course on Basic Robotics conducted at Sri Venkateswara University College of Engineering, Tirupati. This course involved the understanding of design of robots and how to draw, design and operate the robot using ABB Robotics.</h4>
